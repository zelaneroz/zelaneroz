## About Me

Hi, I'm **Zelan Eroz Espanto**—a Computer Science & Math student at **Case Western Reserve University** and a Point & UWC Scholar.

I'm most excited by the intersection of **AI/ML, full-stack development, and data science**. I'm currently working on an LSTM-based forecasting model for sea surface temperature anomalies in the Philippine Sea. I'm also working on a few hackathons and competitions!

When I’m not building, I’m probably exploring a new country or island in the Philippines, reading, watching "Desperate Housewives", making friends, dabbling in film, or asking too many questions!
